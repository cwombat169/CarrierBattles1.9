AI Tag 01 = Leaky Armor
AI Tag 02 = Anti-Missile PD, Light Kinetic Missile
AI Tag 03 = Anti-Fighter PD, Heavy Kinetic Missile
AI Tag 04 = Small Engine
AI Tag 05 = Mid Engine (could be freed if needed)
AI Tag 06 = Big Engine (could be freed if needed)
AI Tag 07 = Fighter Armor
AI Tag 08 = Plasma Weapons
AI Tag 09 = Fighter Engine S3 (and S2)
AI Tag 10 = Fighter Engine S4 
AI Tag 11 = Fighter Engine S5 
AI Tag 12 = Fighter Engine S6
note: It is recommended that an AI modder uses the AI Tags for Fighter Engines as 'must have' abilities and not add Combat Movement as misc ability to fighters. This way a certain speed can be set for a certain design. This can also be used as a trigger ability to start a new generation of fighters.
AI Tag 13 = Repair Bay V and higher
AI Tag 14 = Supply Factory, can be used as a trigger for a design change once Resupply 2 is researched


New Design Created - 
  A design is created when a new Component or Vehicle Size has been researched 
  after the date the design was created. All Vehicle Sizes as fair game, and any 
  components which are part of the design type.

Vehicle Size Used Requirements - 
  Vehicle Type is correct for this Design Type.
  Have the necessary tech for this Vehicle Size.
  Vehicle Size discovery date is equal to or better than that of the last 
    design for this Design Type.
  Vehicle Size falls within the required Minimum and Maximum range of Tonnage.
  Can support the minimum and maximum required speeds.
    (enough spaces for engines to provide the minimum speed)
    (allows no movement for a Maximum Speed of zero) 
  Does not have any Min Percent requirements for a comp type different
    than the Majority Comp Type.
  Does not have any Max Percent requirements for the Majority Comp Type.
