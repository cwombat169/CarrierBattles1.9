General History Description              := The twelve colonies of the Colonial Republic were attacked and destroyed by a race of machines known as the Cylons.  Following this attack a fleet of some two hundred ships, lead by a soon to be retired military commander escaped into the vastness of space.  After nearly twenty years on the run the fleet found a new home world.  Using every last ship as a resource a new colony was founded.  Fearing that the Cylon’s would find and attack them, the majority voted to dismantle the entire fleet, including military ships, and adopt a philosophy of isolation.  For nearly four hundred years they lived in peace.  But now with the resources of their world dwindling, they must once again look to the stars.
