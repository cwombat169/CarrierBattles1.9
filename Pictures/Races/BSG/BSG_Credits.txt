I took creative license with this race. Virtually every image in the race is new work with the exception of Race Portraits and Shield images.

All other images were created using the Doga L3 Graphics editor. *CONTACT ME @ pcpatrocities@hotmail.com if you wish to use the original works contained in this set. You must have my permission prior to using them. Thank you.

PLEASE NOTE:
I took creative license with this set. I wanted to have a set that was consistent throughout. This meant that I could not use existing ship images.
