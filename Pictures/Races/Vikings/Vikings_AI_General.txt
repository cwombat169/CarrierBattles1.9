Name                                     := Space Vikings
Description                              := Renegade berzerkers with horned helmets and impressive fighting skills.

Biological Description                   := The Space Vikings do not consist of a single race. Many different races have adopted the Space Viking way of life. Most of them are bipedal humanoids, but strange galactic beings like giant amoebae have also joined them. Any being which can pass the initiation and fit into a horned helmet is eligible to join.
Society Description                      := Space Viking society is chaotic at best. Being a free willed people they seldom can agree on anything among themselves. They like to go and settle everywhere they please which has resulted in a bad reputation among other races. They are also known as traders (even if they do not excel in it) and enjoy peace and profit as much as everybody else. The Vikings are expert shipbuilders and impressive warriors. To those nations who have overcome their initial prejudice against this loosely based and free willed society, the Space Vikings have become trustworthy allies.
General History Description              := The common link between all Space Vikings is the cult of the Aesir which has its roots in Terran history, and was dormant for thousands of years. It was eventually revived, however, and soon attracted converts from many different species. Scattered clans and colonies were established in all corners of known space, each interpreting the ways of the Aesir differently. Recently though, a new unifying power has emerged, with the influence and leadership to bring the fractious Vikings together under one flag. Viking clans have started uprooting themselves and are now converging on a new Viking homeworld, establishing a galactic power to be reckoned with.
