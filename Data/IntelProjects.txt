For all Messages:
The text "Intelligence Minister: " will be added to the front of all messages relating to 
intelligence projects.
For the Target Message, additional sentences may be added to the end of the message. For 
example, if the target is able to determine who caused the intelligence, a sentence such
as "We suspect the XXX Empire..." will be added to the message.

Target Message 1          := [%PlanetName] has been quarantined due to a sudden epidemic of global proportions.  Two [%SourceEmpireName] were apprehended by local security at a transportation hub, but the plague has already been spread in multiple locations.
Target Message Title 2    := Plague Level 1
Target Message 2          := [%PlanetName] has been quarantined due to a sudden epidemic of global proportions.  Records indicate that a number of suspected [%SourceEmpireName] agents fled the planet a few days before the outbreak was discovered.
Target Message Title 3    := Plague Level 1
Target Message 3          := [%PlanetName] has been quarantined due to a sudden epidemic of global proportions.  We suspect this plague was intentionally released by [%SourceEmpireName] agents.

Target Message 5          := [%PlanetName] has been quarantined due to a sudden epidemic of global proportions.  Forensics experts have discovered traces of [%SourceEmpireName] material in the dispersion device.
