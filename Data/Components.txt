AI Tag 01 = Leaky Armor
AI Tag 02 = Anti-Missile PD, Kinetic Missile
AI Tag 03 = Anti-Fighter PD, Armored Kinetic Missile
AI Tag 04 = Small Engine
AI Tag 05 = Mid Engine (could be freed if needed)
AI Tag 06 = Big Engine (could be freed if needed)
AI Tag 07 = Fighter Armor
AI Tag 08 = Plasma Weapons
AI Tag 09 = Fighter Engine S3 (and S2)
AI Tag 10 = Fighter Engine S4 
AI Tag 11 = Fighter Engine S5 
AI Tag 12 = Fighter Engine S6
note: It is recommended that an AI modder uses the AI Tags for Fighter Engines as 'must have' abilities and not add Combat Movement as misc ability to fighters. This way a certain speed can be set for a certain design.
AI Tag 13 = Repair Bay V and higher
AI Tag 14 = Supply Factory
AI Tag 15 = Plasma Shields or Higher (Avoids ice & orgs cost for BSYs)
AI Tag 16 = Shields after colander tech is researched
AI Tag 17 = 40cm Leaky Armor
AI Tag 18 = 60cm Leaky Armor

    Ships, Planets, Seekers, Fighters, Satellites, Drones

Optional Field - 
Weapon List Target Description:
  If the Weapon List Target Override field is used, this field should
  be present as well. This field provides the description displayed in 
  the component report.
