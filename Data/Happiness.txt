Population Happiness Effects:
- Riot prevents any point generation from that planet.
- If a planet riots for sufficient time, it may rebel.
- Rebellion changes the planet to a new owner.
- Happiness level modifies output of the planet.

All values are in 10ths of a percent.

Name                             := Peaceful
Description                      := Populations enjoy the products of hard work.  Constructing things, building alliances and having patrol ships enforcing the peace all help to keep the populace happy.  Combat is never a good thing, but quick victories minimize the damage.  Enemy troops will quickly demoralize the local population.

Name                             := Bloodthirsty
Description                      := Populations love wars and the spectacle of combat.  They don't care if they win or not, they just like to fight.  Invading troops are nothing out of the ordinary; merely a larger than average street brawl.  Local defense ships are unwelcome, since they are not out fighting something.  Riots are fun, and will not end without an external distraction.

Name                             := Provincial
Description                      := Populations prefer that their race is left alone but do not mind treaties as long as the others do not poke their noses into local business.  They respond poorly to any unusual events, and though they are very slow to anger, they are even slower to forgive.

Name                             := Masochistic
Description                      := Populations enjoy pain and suffering.  They thrive on combat losses, but get upset when they win.  Keep defense ships out of the system, and thus out of sight.  In a pinch, a suicide mission will raise their spirits.  Medical facilities still provide a happiness boost, thanks to a wide range of elective operations.
